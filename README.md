# Final-Project-And-Presentation
The final Project and Presentation, a Powerpoint Document and a Report on findings. 

Acting as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure, the SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working.

This ReadMe file contains the Powerpoint Slides from the group presentation.  Our group focused on the Offensive attack, or the Red Team part of the final project. My specific contribution to this presentation was the _Exploits Used_ section starting on slide six. 

Included is a separate document containing my final written report.
